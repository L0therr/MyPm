# MyPm
My pm is just some bash scripts that help you create some apps (backend, react app, ...)
I Want, in the future to add a documentation for all the packages that are available.

# Getting started
Start now using mypm :)

## Prerequisites
* Git need to be installed on your computer
* Node.js need to be installed on your computer
* You need to be a cool dude (joking)

## Installation
### for windows

* If you dont have a ~/bin folder (or you dont even know what it is) :

[Clone the install script (mypm-install)](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - he will do the work
Then :
```
cd [clone folder by default : mypm-installation]
bash mypm-install.sh
```
Follow the instructions - You can delete the mypm-install clone folder.

and your all set :)

* If you already have a ~/bin folder :
```
cd ~/bin
git clone https://github.com/L0therr/MyPm.git
cd [clone folder name]
mv * ../
cd ..
rm -rf [clone folder name]
```
and your all set :)


# Using
Everywhere on your shell terminal you can run :
```
bash mypm.sh
```
and you can use the script :)
Enjoy !
